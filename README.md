# thrity-game-app
An addictive game of matching the tile with the same number. Reach 30 to win the game!!! <br>
Created with only html, css, vanilla javascript by utilizing Canvas API, and bootstrap for a little bit of styling. 

## introduction
This is my first javascript game, inspired from "Twenty" mobile game created by Stephen French. I personally love that game, it's super addictive, but it only "twenty". Hence, I intended to extend the maximum number to win the game to "thirty". <br>
I use this project as my opportunity to learn more advance javascript algorithm, problem solving, and OOP. I also create this project for my personal portfolio. 
It was difficult, but finally, i managed to finish this project. It was fun and challanging.
