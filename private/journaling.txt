Day 0 - Try to find Inspiration
Day 1 - Cuman pusingin gimana cara bikin gamenya. Nonton Anime, Ambil air, sama reflecting kayak hari kemarin biar jadi orang yang paham diri aja. 

I learned that it's hard to find job if i don't have relation. I am getting more worried after that. 

Gua inget banget saat saat gua bimbang memilih masa depan gua. Hari demi hari berlalu dan gua semakin sangat khawatir dan insecure. Di saat itulah gua memutuskan untuk belajar coding dan berkomitmen untuk menantang diri untuk mengambil karir pertama gua sebagai programmer atau software developer padahal gua kan jurusan Teknik sipil.

The only way so that I can change is to start have a glimpse that I am not in such a normal situation to bear and start to think that my situation is suck and I need to get out of this. I am salute to my past self because that count for action or making decision and it actually change my life and more importantly, my action, the formula i am looking for. 

16 March, The secret to change is by doing. I do not think through living. The thing after I always do after intense reflection and rumination is what actually changed me. I wonder if I've been doing the right thing. 

Day 2 ~ 6 
I create basic physics for the game.


25 March

Last night, i finished up a bit part of my Twenty project. then, i questioning about what anime to watch next. But then, I started to wonder why do i still care about this.

It's been one year since March 2021, well that's obvious. Honestly, one of biggest regrets that I have is I was not figuring out what I want and what I need as soon as possible. I wasn't thinking a lot about my future and In fact I am afraid about my future, I am afraid about what kind of person I become, I am afraid to face the reality of life. Because I am afraid, I have this perspective, "do while I still can" perspective of life which leads me to me being super depraved and lazy. 

Mei-June 2021, my life is so comfortable, while i am watching super relaxing non non biyori Anime. Although I already know, subconsiously that this period will end, and I have to face it, so I am a little bit sad that time honestly.

28 March
I wake up in the morning, I don't know what to do. And the reason is I don't even know what I want. I don't have a target in the future. I freaked out about how directionless I am. While don't really have a friend and apparent opportunity is makes me discouraged and sad. The one thing really sad about me is how directionless I am. I am sad not because I don't see anything in the future, I am sad because of my Inaction or Indecision.

It's me, it's fuckin me, it's all on me.

I always have this sudden sadness. I felt insecure about my safety in the future.
The reason probably is I do not feel good about what I am doing.
Another reason is probably because, Wow I have to endure this much, much longer again.
or probably I just simply do not like my life.
or probably everything feels the same.
or probably I am stagnant.
or the reason is probably I simply alone and I crave social interaction.
