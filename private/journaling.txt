Day 0 - Try to find Inspiration
Day 1 - Cuman pusingin gimana cara bikin gamenya. Nonton Anime, Ambil air, sama reflecting kayak hari kemarin biar jadi orang yang paham diri aja. 

I learned that it's hard to find job if i don't have relation. I am getting more worried after that. 

Gua inget banget saat saat gua bimbang memilih masa depan gua. Hari demi hari berlalu dan gua semakin sangat khawatir dan insecure. Di saat itulah gua memutuskan untuk belajar coding dan berkomitmen untuk menantang diri untuk mengambil karir pertama gua sebagai programmer atau software developer padahal gua kan jurusan Teknik sipil.

The only way so that I can change is to start have a glimpse that I am not in such a normal situation to bear and start to think that my situation is suck and I need to get out of this. I am salute to my past self because that count for action or making decision and it actually change my life and more importantly, my action, the formula i am looking for. 

16 March, The secret to change is by doing. I do not think through living. The thing after I always do after intense reflection and rumination is what actually changed me. I wonder if I've been doing the right thing. 

Day 2 ~ 6 
I create basic physics for the game.


25 March

Last night, i finished up a bit part of my Twenty project. then, i questioning about what anime to watch next. But then, I started to wonder why do i still care about this. 


_________________________________________________________________________________
It's been one year since March 2021, well that's obvious. Honestly, one of biggest regrets that I have is I was not figuring out what I want and what I need as soon as possible. I wasn't thinking a lot about my future and In fact I am afraid about my future, I am afraid about what kind of person I become, I am afraid to face the reality of life. Because I am afraid, I have this perspective, "do while I still can" perspective of life which leads me to me being super depraved and lazy. 

Mei-June 2021, my life is so comfortable, while i am watching super relaxing non non biyori Anime. Although I already know, subconsiously that this period will end, and I have to face it, so I am a little bit sad that time honestly.

28 March
I wake up in the morning, I don't know what to do. And the reason is I don't even know what I want. I don't have a target in the future. I freaked out about how directionless I am. While don't really have a friend and apparent opportunity is makes me discouraged and sad. The one thing really sad about me is how directionless I am. I am sad not because I don't see anything in the future, I am sad because of my Inaction or Indecision.

It's me, it's fuckin me, it's all on me. 

29 March

I always have this sudden sadness. I felt insecure about my safety in the future.
The reason probably is I do not feel good about what I am doing.
Another reason is probably because, Wow I have to endure this much, much longer again.  

31 March

When I think about it, one thing that makes me super uncomfortable, is Time. Time suck, I hate time. It's super duper restraining. it's limits my potential. it reminded me of future, or what will come. It makes me worry all the time because we probably not gonna make it in time. But, guess what? I think time is reality. when something is already scheduled in certain date, it started to felt real, it started to felt urgent. ENTP afraid of real experiences. I need to learn to be comfortable with time. There is a "order" element in time, but ENTP are chaotic human being.

4 April

It's not coding that burns me out, I finally realized this. It's my current situation, the context of my situation which subconsiously affect my emotion in general. I've been doing this for four and half months since I commit myself to learn programming. Actually it's almost 6 months since I consider this decision. It's been months and it's so frustation that I do not get the result yet. There is a guilt factor that contributes because of this. 

As bad as my situation is, and how upset I am towards family and world in general. I am more upset about myself. The situation is Bad, and I felt like it's my duty to fix the situation. But, I am so weak now that I can't handle it. I also had my problem too, like the fear that I have that also screw me. 

The guilt and shame is so bad that I can't even felt at ease while learning to code, especially when I stuck. especially when it's almost 5 months I've commit myself to learn programming. I never at peace with myself, the action is never justified by my inner self. I never.. ever... felt good about what i am doing. 

The guilt, shame, fear, helplessness, bored, anxious about safety. The burden to bear while learning to code which is the activity that needs great amount of mental space. That!! Thats.. precisely why I am so burned out, frustated. It takes a lot of energy. 


game issue: 
- sudden tile lost;

_________________________________________________________________________________

During my collage, when I still in Bandung, my life is very comfortable. The place I live in and the condition in general is super comfortable. Although there is a lot of things going on in my collage from job desk or study itself or events, I found myself fighting for the sake of being comfortable. I just hope that things just go away so I can relax and do not have a lot of things in my mind. I guilty of it, seriously, because how comfortable I am. 

When doing my thesis, I also fighting for the sake of being comfortable. In the process, there is a lot of drama in my mind because I have this another comfort creature, Anime, but at the same time I have to fight for the sake of comfort because I have to do this annoying thesis. Another conflict is this period will end, so I thought "This period will end so why do I not use this opportunity to be comfortable as much as possible". Before I know it, collage and "status as a student" become my comfort zone. Probably, the perception of "I still need time to learn programming" probably is my current comfort creature. 

Best lesson I learned today is that pain is inevitable. Preach it cs joseph! That cognitive function is a fuckin real thing. 

My comfort creature, random youtube video, reading books (yes I admit it, it is a comfort creature), learning to code excessively (it is comfort creature), my collage (is a fuckin comfort creature). 

Recently, I reflect a lot about what is the thing, hidden thing, that holds me back from moving forward in life. That day, I have a lot of thought about if I move forward it means bla bla bla. For example, If I already had a job, it means I have manager, it means that I started to have new routine, it means I no longer have full control over my life 24h and something has to intervere. 

I trying to find the reason, the things that holds me back. Then, I reLife-ing the time when I still in collage, especially during my thesis. It felt suck, most of the time. Well, this current time is also suck. My entire life always feels suck tbh, usually during stressful time, presentation, deadlines, obligations, everything real that I felt unmotivated to do so anyway. The night when I have my presentation to my supervisor is so bothering. It suck because how bothered I am. I have no choice but to focus on that thing. Because of Se demon, i always felt that I am the only one who is struggling, other people seems to not bothered as much. But me? super bothered, like I wish this thing just go away so I can have freedom on my own. It adds up to that suckness. 

Is this the precise thing that always holds me back? very simple but affect a hell lot of things. I thought i already escaped from myself, the reality of myself. There is a burden of Si inferior that I have to bear all the time. The suckness is still there, the pain is still there. this realization made me realize that pain is inevitable and I should learned to be okay with it. I really think that until this time, I probably trying to escape from that pain, pain of being myself, and I just hate it and I tried to become other people and hating my life in general. 

I can't escape from pain, I can't escape from myself, pain is inevitable.
